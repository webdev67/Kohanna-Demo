The purpose of this app is to demonstrate my ability in coding using the Kohana 3.0 framework on top of PHP 5. 

It is a very basic app that populates a database table based on data grabbed from a Twitter API - you can search for
anything you like on twitter , and it will save the items for you in the table.
